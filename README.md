# Hulu Clone by Kaushik

A Hulu clone using Next JS, Tailwind CSS & Heroicons for the front-end and TMDB API for the data.

I have deployed this app on vercel at [https://hulu-clone-kaushikbanerjee.vercel.app/](https://hulu-clone-kaushikbanerjee.vercel.app/).

## What is in it?

- Watchlist functionality is there and you can add *yet to be watched* movies into that list.
- Movies are segregated by various genres and you can look around for movies in whatever genre you prefer.

## What's not in it? 

- Obviously, you **can't watch** any of the movies or tv shows. This is just a project for my portfolio. 
- ~~Don't try **altering the url**, it won't work either.~~
