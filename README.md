A Hulu clone using Next JS, Tailwind CSS & Heroicons for the front-end and TMDB API for the data.

I have deployed this app on firebase at [https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/](https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/).

## What is in it?

- You can surf around the site to find details about your favourite movies.
- Watchlist functionality is there and you can add *yet to be watched* movies into that list.
- Movies are segregated by various genres and you can look around for movies in whatever genre you prefer.
- There is a search functionality available and don't forget to choose whether you are searching for a movie or a tv show. 
- Casting Page is available, just look for the button. 
- Some of your local language movies may be available, try looking for them.
  
## What's not in it? 

- Obviously, you **can't watch** any of the movies or tv shows. This is just a project for my portfolio. 
- ~~Don't try **altering the url**, it won't work either.~~
